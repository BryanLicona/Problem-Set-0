# Implement two functions:
# dollars_to_float should accept a 'str' as input (formated $##.##)
# each # is a decimal digit
# remove the leading $
# return the amount as a float ( ex. input $50.00, output 50.0)
# percent_to_float should accept a 'str' as input (formated ##%)
# each # is a decimal digit
# remove the trailing %
# return the percentage as a float ( ex. input 15%, output 0.15)
