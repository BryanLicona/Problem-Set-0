# 1 - Implement a function called 'convert'
# 2 - 'Convert' needs to accept a str as input & return the same input with any :) converted to emoji
# 3 - also any :( with a sad face emoji
# 4 - All other text should be returned unchanged
# 5 - Create a function called 'main' that prompts the user for input
#     it should call 'convert' on that input, and print the results
# 6 - 'main' needs to be called at the bottom of the file

def main():
    statement = input("Enter your sentence: ")
    print(statement)
    statement = convert(statement)
    print(statement)

def convert (statement):
    statement = statement.replace(":)", "🙂")
    statement = statement.replace(":(", "🙁")
    return statement

main()
